We [enable](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) Responsible AI and data science at [the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (Nav)](https://nav.no).

We provide feedback, guidance, and technical assistance, in addition to shaping policy and governance frameworks. We keep abreast of trends in AI/ML and data science by partnering with research institutions, participating in conferences and meetups, and exploring new technology and methods, sharing what we learn both inside and outside of Nav.

## What our team members are working on right now:

- Providing responsible AI perspectives in Nav's Copilot-pilot.
- A Responsible AI analysis of Nav Contact Center's chatbot "Bob".
- Contributing to Nav's consultation response on the Norwegian implementation of EU's AI Act.
- Participating in the core working group that's drafting an AI governance system for Nav.
- Planning the next TADAgen about standards for LLMs in public administration.
- This homepage.
