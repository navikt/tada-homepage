We [enable](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) Responsible AI and data science at [the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (Nav)](https://nav.no).

We provide feedback, guidance, and technical assistance, in addition to shaping policy and governance frameworks. We keep abreast of trends in AI/ML and data science by partnering with research institutions, participating in conferences and meetups, and exploring new technology and methods, sharing what we learn both inside and outside of Nav.
