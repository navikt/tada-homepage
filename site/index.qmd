We [enable](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) Responsible AI and data science at [the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (Nav)](https://nav.no).

We are responsible for maintaining Nav's [Principles for responsible AI](https://aksel.nav.no/god-praksis/artikler/prinsipper-for-ansvarlig-ki-i-nav), as well as providing guidance on how the principles can be complied with in practise. 

We provide feedback, guidance, and technical assistance, in addition to shaping policy and governance frameworks. We keep abreast of trends in AI/ML and data science by partnering with research institutions, participating in conferences and meetups, and exploring new technology and methods, sharing what we learn both inside and outside of Nav.

## What our team members are working on right now:

- Providing responsible AI perspectives in Nav's Copilot-pilot.
- A Responsible AI analysis of Nav Contact Center's chatbot "Bob".
- Contributing to Nav's consultation response on the Norwegian implementation of EU's AI Act.
- Participating in the core working group that's drafting an AI governance system for Nav.
- Planning the next TADAgen about standards for LLMs in public administration.
