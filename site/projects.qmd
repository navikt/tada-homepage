## Model Cards

A model card is a short, standardised document that accompanies ML-models carrying key information about the model. They make the model’s capabilities, constraints, and ethical footprint explicit, enabling responsible deployment and easier governance.

 Model cards contribute to:

* **Transparency** : Stakeholders can quickly the models intendended purpose, training data, performance tests and known limitations.

* **Accountability** : Provenance information improves auditability and compliance.

* **Safety** : Surfacing bias metrics, failure cases and ethical considerations made, model cards can help mitigate unintended harm.

Model cards are recommended as a governance tool. To this end [TADA is exploring their feasbility and fit](kortstokken) in Nav. 


## AI-act navigation tools
TADA is working with KI-gruppa/Juridisk in developing tools to help teams in Nav navigate the upcoming AI-act.
